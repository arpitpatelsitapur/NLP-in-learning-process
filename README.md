# My NLP Learning Journey - Not completed, still in progress

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey learning Natural Language Processing (NLP)! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, each covering different concepts, algorithms, and projects related to NLP.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating area of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human languages in a valuable and meaningful way.

In this repository, I explore various NLP concepts, from the basics of text processing to more advanced topics like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation. 

## What's Inside

This repository is structured to facilitate both beginners and intermediate learners in navigating through different concepts in NLP. Here's what you can expect to find:

- **Basic Text Processing**: Learn about tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and other preprocessing steps.
- **Text Representation Techniques**: Notebooks on bag-of-words (BoW), TF-IDF, word embeddings, and more.
- **Machine Learning Models for NLP**: Introduction to using machine learning algorithms in NLP, including Naive Bayes, SVM, and neural networks.
- **Deep Learning for NLP**: Dive into deep learning models like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers, and understand how they are applied in NLP.
- **NLP Applications**: Projects and examples on sentiment analysis, chatbots, named entity recognition (NER), and machine translation.


## Prerequisites

Before diving into these notebooks, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of:

- `Python` programming
- Basic `machine learning` concepts
- Some familiarity with `linear algebra` and `calculus`
